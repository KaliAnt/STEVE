# S.T.E.V.E. - Space Travel with the Extraordinary Valiant Explorer
#### A 2D Unity mobile game.

### About


The purpose of the game is to survive as much as you can. You control a space entity capable of consuming resources in order to evolve. The resources are mined by fetchers, but their numbers are limited and the resources are hidden. In order to spot a resource it has to appear in the field of view of your eyes. Enemies are roaming around and can deal damage if they are in range.
